1. Know What Can Be Recycled: Common recyclable materials include:
    Paper (newspapers, magazines, office paper)
    Cardboard (flatten boxes)
    Plastics (check for recycling symbols #1 and #2, and follow local guidelines)
    Glass (bottles and jars)
    Metals (aluminum cans, tin cans)
2. Clean and Dry: Rinse containers to remove food residue. Clean items are more likely to be recycled.
3. Sort Materials: Keep recyclables separated from regular trash. Some places have single-stream recycling, while others require separation.
4. Check Local Guidelines: Recycling rules vary by location. Check with your local waste management for specific instructions.
5. Drop-Off or Curbside: Use curbside pickup if available or find a local recycling center for drop-off.
6. Avoid Contamination: Donâ€™t mix non-recyclables with recyclables, as this can ruin entire batches.
7. Reduce and Reuse: Before recycling, consider reducing consumption and reusing items when possible.
